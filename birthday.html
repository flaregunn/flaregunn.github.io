<div id="lyrics-1">
I hit the club with all my ice on
I turn the lights on
My tool on me
Who this nigga staring at my jewelry
Gang with me
Bang with me
We start shooting in the club
If you scared to tote a gun, you cant hang with me
Run up in yo bitch house
Where them kilos?
Got some bald headed Mexicans
Shout out my Migos
I knock on a nigga door, shoot him through the peep hole
I just knocked a nigga out, what he was mugging me for?
Nun but killers in my squad, dont make call up Tito
Young nigga, but is extorting niggas like Im Debo
They aint let me in with this pole, they shouldve searched me at the door
This nigga blood on my shoe, we stumped a nigga in the floor
Say ya love me baby, whats the meanin of that shit?
I dont drink codeine, I aint with that leaning and shit
Got a new tool, put a red beam on that bitch
Never wife a bitch, I never bought a ring for a bitch
You gone make me pull up on yo motherfuckin block
Get to clappin
I shoot yo ass, 187 fuck this rap shit
Tec-9s, AR-15s, and a MAC 10
Im out west, where we gang bang and kidnap shit
Its shooters in yo house, bitch, since you wanna sneak diss
On the internet
Twitter beef
Nigga tweet this
9, I run up on yo ass from behind
Are ya lackin? bullets hit yo ass in yo spine
Boy Ya Actin, ya get caught in that jam, and drop a dime
Bitch was givin my mans top, while I was hittin her from behind
This that street shit, call 4nem, we on that heat shit
Hot shit
Pull up on yo block, then drop shit
We pop shit
Im Robbin jeans saggin, I aint with all of that Rocks shit
My tooley come
Call my gun connect, he bring me stupid Glocks
Stupid watch
Filled with stupid diamonds
I dont even know what time it is
I barely know where my mind is
No time to waste, these bullets gone hit yo face
Gone make me catch a case
Young nigga with felonies
Couldnt stay with my OG, she was on section 8
No Discriminate we pull up on yo block
And then kill any race
Mini man, Im yelling many man
4nem jump out that mini van

I fell off in the club with some thugs
And the semi tucked
Heard you want a war with a thug, you aint hood enough
I fuck a nigga up, paramedics gotta pick him up
She say she wanna fuck with a thug, cause my money up
[x2]

You dont wanna get caught in the street
Chest full of lead, and a head full of heat
Whats with all this twitter beef? we can meet
Give a fuck, imma see ya on the streets
You better run, boa we do this shit for fun
Youd be smart if you go and buy a gun
I got a fucked up attitude, very rude
Say its beef, now Im shooting up a school
I lay that murder game down, Im a fool
Im a rapper but dont get this shit confused
That boy dont wanna use his head, he gone lose
Then I shoot him and that bitch with this Uzi
Red Beams everywhere
Bullets flyin everywhere
Better run nigga, move it
I kick a nigga door in, shooters on the low end
Call em up and they shootin
This stupid bitch tryna fool me
We got enough clips in this bitch to shoot a movie
Cops in my rear view, flushing through the traffic
Kill yo mans, he tried to testify, catch his ass in traffic
Nigga get yo rolls up
Nigga get yo poles up
Young wild niggas
They gone bring the poles up
You aint gang nigga
You dont bang nigga
You dont slang
We gone hit yo block
We gone find out where you hang, Dangling

I fell off in the club with some thugs
And the semi tucked
Heard you want a war with a thug, you aint hood enough
I fuck a nigga up, paramedics gotta pick him up
She say she wanna fuck with a thug, cause my money up
